Low molecular weight hyaluronic acid is made up of tiny fragments that the skin perceives as a deterioration in its own hyaluronic acid. The skin responds by activating its own hyaluronic acid synthesis and boosting its self-hydration mechanism. The Essence-in-Lotion has an incredibly fine, light texture and reveals plumped, smoother, and visibly more beautiful skin.

<br><br><b>What else you need to know:</b><br> For 15 years, Guerlain Research has been pushing back the frontiers of cellular longevity. Now it has identified a new mechanism that plays a key role in longevity: cellular respiration. More effective thanks to the discovery of the extraordinary powers of a duo of orchids, Cell Respiration&trade; technology delivers superior efficacy inside the skin. It regulates cellular respiration and combats hypoxia* or oxygen deficiency, a phenomenon that increases with age. The cells can breathe again and maximize energy production which boosts cell regeneration*. All the visible signs of aging are minimized: wrinkles and fine lines fade, the skin regains firmness, density, and elasticity, and the complexion is even and more radiant. The skin is infused with a breath of life. *In vitro tests on ingredient.
<br><br>The orchid, a rare and precious raw ingredient, is the very essence of the exceptional  complete care range Orchid&#233;e Imp&#233;riale. A genuine longevity prodigy, the orchid is the most developed species in the plant kingdom. Convinced of its exceptional potential, Guerlain set up its first research center ever to be devoted to an ingredient: the Orchidarium&reg;.
