The feather-light formula absorbs quickly for an instant dose of radiance while helping balance skin for a healthy, vibrant glow.  <br><br>Vitamin A Improves the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, boosts firmness, evens tone and enhances radiance. Vitamin B is a moisturizing humectant that helps balance oil production and soothe. Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant that evens tone, brightens, and protects against skin-aging free radicals. Vitamin D helps improve the skin’s barrier while shielding against UV damage. Vitamin E intercepts free radicals to prevent skin damage as it softens. Vitamin F helps improve texture and barrier function. <br><br><b>What it is formulated WITHOUT:</b><br>- Parabens<br>- Sulfates<br>- Phthalates<br><br><b>What else you need to know:</b><br> &quot;Applying vitamins topically is just as important as taking a daily multi-vitamin supplement.

<br><br><b>Solutions for:</b><br>- Oiliness<br>- Blemishes<br>- Dryness<br><br><b>If you want to know more…</b><br>Experience quick-absorbing hydration with this weightless version of Josie’s signature 100% Pure Argan Oil. Using a proprietary process, 100% Pure Argan Oil Light selects the lightest elements of Pure Argan Oil to deliver quicker-absorbing yet equally powerful benefits. This multitasking moisturizer nourishes and protects skin with vitamin E, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids for an optimally balanced, health-looking glow. Use as a daily moisturizer or as a hydrating makeup primer that visibly reduces fine lines and wrinkles while improving skin smoothness and hydration. Fear not if your skin is oily. This must-have oil is especially ideal for those with breakout-prone and sensitive skin.
<br><br><b>What else you need to know:</b><br>Josie's Argan Oil Light is cold-pressed to ensure the most powerful, highest-grade oil. It is 100 percent pure, 100 percent natural, and free of any synthetics, fillers, or fragrance. Housed in a recyclable glass bottle and purchased from women's cooperatives in Morocco to support their social and economic welfare. These cooperatives work within a protected UNESCO biosphere reserve that ensures the protection and reforestation of Argan trees. 
<br><br>The amber glass is not just for looks! Unlike clear glass, amber glass filters out damaging blue and ultra-violet light that can break down the oil's beneficial compounds and nutrients, ultimately reducing it's effectiveness and potency.
