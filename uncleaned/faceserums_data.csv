Sunday Riley,U.F.O. Salicylic Acid BHA Treatment Face Oil,$52.00 ,Size: 0.5 oz/ 15 mL,"Salicylic Acid; Good for: Pores ; Best for Oily, Combo, Normal Skin; Best for Combination Skin; Cruelty-Free","<b>Which skin type is it good for?</b><br>&#10004; Normal<br>&#10004; Oily
<br>&#10004; Combination<br>&#10004; Dry<br>&#10004;  Sensitive
<br><br><b>What it is:</b><br>A quick-absorbing, medicated dry oil to clear congested pores, treat and prevent acne, and smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles for clearer, smoother skin. 
<br><br><b>Solutions for:</b><br>- Acne and blemishes<br>- Blackheads<br>- Pores
<br><br><b>If you want to know more…</b><br>With 1.5 percent salicylic acid, this fast-acting, quick-drying, medicated oil clears acne and blackhead-causing buildup and debris from congested pores for smoother, blemish-free skin. Tea tree oil and black cumin seed oil support clear skin, while hexylresorcinol and licorice naturally brighten the appearance of old acne discolorations for a more even-toned complexion.  <br><br>Counterbalancing the potentially drying effects of salicylic acid, milk thistle, and cucumber seed oil nourish the skin and smooth the appearance of lines and wrinkles, without leaving a greasy residue. Chamomile and neroli soothe stressed, blemish-prone skin.  
<br><br><b>What it is formulated WITHOUT:</b><br>- Parabens<br>- Sulfates<br>- Phthalates
<br><br><b>What else you need to know:</b><br>&quot;When I formulated U.F.O., I wanted to create a dry oil that practically disappears into the skin, leaving oily skin smooth (but never greasy) and yet effectively treated for blemishes and blackheads. Salicylic acid is notoriously over-drying, leaving your skin stripped and looking irritated. By infusing salicylic acid into clarifying oils (like tea tree oil and black cumin seed oil), the drying effects of salicylic acid are nipped in the bud, while all of the treatment aspects (like clearing congested pores and managing blackheads and blemishes) are in full-force. U.F.O. is part of the new Green Line, along with Martian Mattiyfing Melting Water-Gel Toner, created specifically for oily skin clients.&quot;&#151;Sunday Riley

<br><br><b>Solutions for:</b><br>- Dullness and uneven texture
<br><br><b>If you want to know more…</b><br> Daily, skin faces an onslaught of aggressors including UV rays, stress, and pollution. The solution: the new One Essential, with a more powerful formula that targets 100 percent of both outdoor (microparticles, heavy metals) and&#151;for the first time&#151;indoor toxins (per an in vitro test on ingredients) such as carpet, glue, varnishes, and electronic devices. This Super Serum is the fundamental first step, before any other skincare product, for a revitalizing effect. When applied twice per day, One Essential purifies and strengthens the skin, and the effectiveness of your usual skincare routine is boosted and prolonged by up to four times.
<br><br><b>What it is formulated WITHOUT:</b><br>- Parabens<br>- Sulfates<br>- Phthalates
<br><br><b>What else you need to know:</b><br> The source of the Red Hibiscus is the Dior Garden located in the heart of the Koro Ecological and Cultural Site. In this garden, covering 20 hectares, nearly 190 plant species flourish, representing an astonishing 18 percent of all species found in Burkina Faso. This remarkable site was selected due to its distinctive geology and the richness of its soil. More than a hectare is entirely devoted to cultivating the hibiscus sabdariffa, or red hibiscus.
<br><br>The Dior Research Center studied the red hibiscus flower and discovered extraordinary detoxifying power. Red hibiscus extract has been shown to stimulate the recycling process of toxins that have penetrated the cell's lung. 
<br><br> One Essential quadruples the effects of active ingredients in the skincare products that follow (in vitro test on different major anti-aging ingredients) like retinol, vitamin C, longoza, hyaluronic acid, and bifidus for lasting radiance.
