Tatcha,Luminous Deep Hydration Lifting Mask,$123.00 ,Size: 4 x 0.68 oz/ 20 mL masks,Clean at Sephora; Good for: Dryness; Good for: Uneven Texture; Good for: Loss of firmness,"<b>Which skin type is it good for?</b><br>&#10004; Normal<br>&#10004; Oily<br>&#10004; Combination<br>&#10004; Dry<br>&#10004; Sensitive
<br><br><b>What it is:</b><br>A unique, coconut-derived sheet mask that boosts the moisture content of skin by up to 200 percent in 15 minutes for a luminous, plump-looking complexion.
<br><br><b>Solutions for:</b>
<br>- Dryness
<br>- Dullness and uneven texture
<br>- Loss of firmness and elasticity 

<br><br><b>If you want to know more…</b><br>This biocellulose treatment mask contains an anti-aging serum: a proprietary complex of Okinawa red algae and natural hyaluronic acid that delivers an instantly hydrated, firmed, and lifted appearance. Each mask is distilled from an entire coconut into an ultra-concentrated mask, forming an occlusive layer on the skin and allowing for 53 percent more efficient penetration of its serum than paper masks. The pure and powerful active ingredients are able to quickly saturate the skin, infusing revitalizing moisture and plumping away the appearance of fine lines. Tatcha's signature Hadasei-3&#151;a trio of anti-aging Japanese superfoods born from nourishing green tea, rice, and algae&#151;restores a healthy-looking, youthful radiance.

<br><br><b>What else you need to know:</b><br> The remarkable efficacy of the geisha’s mask treatments can be traced back centuries to an ancient beauty text. Etched onto its pages is the depiction of tea kettles with swatches of kimono silk set atop lids to capture the essence of botanicals distilled by steam overnight. Rich in vital fresh extracts, the saturated cloth would then be applied to the geisha’s face. The Luminous Deep Hydration Lifting Mask brings this timeless practice to life with an advanced sheet mask. 
<br><br>This pure formula is non-irritating, non-sensitizing, dermatologist tested, cruelty-free, and formulated without synthetic fragrances, mineral oil, sulfate detergents, urea, DEA, or TEA. 
<br><br>Beauty that gives back: every Tatcha purchase you make supports girls’ education around the world. Tatcha is proud to partner with Room to Read to transform girls’ futures.&#151;Victoria Tsai, Founder
<br><br><b>Research results:</b><br>In a clinical study: 
<br>- 100% of women experienced a 197% increase in hydration after 15 minutes 
<br><br>In a consumer use study after just 1 use: 
<br>- 100% of women agreed that their skin felt smoother 
<br>- 100% of women agreed that their skin felt firmer
